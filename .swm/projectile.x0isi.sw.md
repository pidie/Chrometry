Projectiles are objects fired from guns. They store information on what will happen when they collide with a `VitalsColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsColliderController.cs:7:5:5:`    public class VitalsColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/>. If they do not make said collision, they will eventually destroy themselves.

Because this deals damage, it inherits from the `IDamager` interface.
