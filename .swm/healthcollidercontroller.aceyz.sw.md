The `HealthColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:6:5:5:`    public class HealthColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/> detects collisions that could affect the `HealthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:18:5:5:`    public class HealthController : MonoBehaviour`"/>. It references a `HealthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:18:5:5:`    public class HealthController : MonoBehaviour`"/> and activates events for it.<br/>

## Fields

`damageModifier`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:8:9:9:`        [SerializeField] private float damageModifier = 1f;`"/> - a multiplier for damage detected by this collider

`healthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:9:9:9:`        [SerializeField] private HealthController healthController;`"/> - the `HealthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:18:5:5:`    public class HealthController : MonoBehaviour`"/> reference for this instance

<br/>

## Functions

`OnTriggerEnter`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:11:5:5:`        private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)`"/> - if the collision was a `projectile`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:13:3:3:`            var projectile = other.gameObject.GetComponent&lt;Projectile&gt;();`"/>, calls `HandleProjectileCollision`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:25:5:5:`        private void HandleProjectileCollision(Projectile projectile)`"/>.

`OnCollisionEnter`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:18:5:5:`        private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)`"/> - if the collision was a `projectile`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:20:3:3:`            var projectile = collision.gameObject.GetComponent&lt;Projectile&gt;();`"/>, calls `HandleProjectileCollision`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:25:5:5:`        private void HandleProjectileCollision(Projectile projectile)`"/>.

`HandleProjectileCollision`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:25:5:5:`        private void HandleProjectileCollision(Projectile projectile)`"/> - takes a `Projectile`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Projectile.cs:5:5:5:`    public class Projectile : MonoBehaviour`"/>.

*   calls the `UpdateHealth`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:60:5:5:`        public void UpdateHealth(float value)`"/> method of the `healthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:9:9:9:`        [SerializeField] private HealthController healthController;`"/>
    
*   calls the `CollideWithObject`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Projectile.cs:29:5:5:`        public void CollideWithObject() =&gt; Destroy(gameObject);`"/> method of the `projectile`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:25:9:9:`        private void HandleProjectileCollision(Projectile projectile)`"/>
    

<br/>

## Notes

*   There can be multiple `HealthColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:6:5:5:`    public class HealthColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/>s for one `HealthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:18:5:5:`    public class HealthController : MonoBehaviour`"/>
    
*   A single game object can have multiple `HealthColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthColliderController.cs:6:5:5:`    public class HealthColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/>s for different `HealthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:18:5:5:`    public class HealthController : MonoBehaviour`"/>s, but should not have more than one for the same controller
