# Overview

This article will go through the process of how damage is dealt in Chrometry. It is a process that involves a few different scripts working together, including `IDamager`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Interfaces/IDamager.cs:3:5:5:`	public interface IDamager`"/>, `VitalsColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsColliderController.cs:7:5:5:`    public class VitalsColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/>, and `VitalsController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsController.cs:9:7:7:`    public abstract class VitalsController : MonoBehaviour`"/>.

In addition to the above, this article will go through specifically how the player deals damage to opponents with the gun, which will also use the `Gun`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/TooManyCrosshairs/_Demo/Scripts/Gun.cs:7:5:5:`    public class Gun : MonoBehaviour`"/>, `GunMod`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Data/Scripts/GunMod.cs:7:5:5:`    public class GunMod : ScriptableObject`"/>, and `Projectile`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:6:5:5:`    public class Projectile : MonoBehaviour, IDamager`"/> classes.

# Damage Basics

The `IDamager`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Interfaces/IDamager.cs:3:5:5:`	public interface IDamager`"/> interface is inherited by any class that will deal damage. Currently, those classes are the `Projectile`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:6:5:5:`    public class Projectile : MonoBehaviour, IDamager`"/>, the `ExplosionController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/ExplosionController.cs:7:5:5:`    public class ExplosionController : MonoBehaviour, IDamager`"/>, and the `DamageZoneController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/DamageZoneController.cs:7:5:5:`    public class DamageZoneController : MonoBehaviour, IDamager`"/>. Each object with one of these components also has a `Collider`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsColliderController.cs:28:7:7:`        protected void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)`"/> component.

While instantiated, there is a chance that the collider from the damager will interact with the collider of an object with a `VitalsColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsColliderController.cs:7:5:5:`    public class VitalsColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/>. During this interaction, two methods within the vitals collider controller will trigger the damage to be dealt:

<br/>

<br/>

The vitals collider detects a collision involving an `IDamager`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsColliderController.cs:30:11:11:`            var damager = other.GetComponent&lt;IDamager&gt;();`"/>. **Line 36** submits a damage report.

```c#
28             protected void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
29             {
30                 var damager = other.GetComponent<IDamager>();
31     
32                 if (damager != null)
33                 {
34                     damager.SetIsInDamagerCollider(true);
35                     TimeSinceLastCollision = 0;
36                     HandleIDamagerCollision(damager);
37                 }
38             }
```

<br/>

The damage is calculated and reported to the `VitalsController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsController.cs:9:7:7:`    public abstract class VitalsController : MonoBehaviour`"/>.

83                 if (damager.WillCriticallyHit)
84                     damage *= damager.CritDamageMultiplier;
85                 
86                 vitalsController.UpdateValue(damage * -1f * damageMultiplier);
