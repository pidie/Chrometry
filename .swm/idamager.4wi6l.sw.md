### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Interfaces/IDamager.cs
```c#
9      		public void CollideWithObject();
10     		public void SetIsInDamagerCollider(bool value);
```

<br/>

`CollideWithObject`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Interfaces/IDamager.cs:9:5:5:`		public void CollideWithObject();`"/> - used to handle what happens to the damager when it collides with an object

*   Specifically, this will be a collision with a type of `VitalsColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsColliderController.cs:7:5:5:`    public class VitalsColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/>.
    

`SetIsInDamagerCollider`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Interfaces/IDamager.cs:10:5:5:`		public void SetIsInDamagerCollider(bool value);`"/> - Used to indicate that an entity is in a zone that deals continuous damage over time
