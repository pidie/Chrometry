# Overview

This script is responsible for supplying controlled, artificial gravity to game objects it is attached to.

Each physics update, a downward force is added to either the transform or the `CharacterController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Tools/GravitationalForce.cs:15:3:3:`        private CharacterController _characterController;`"/> component if it is attached to a player character. This increase is stopped and reset when the object is grounded.
