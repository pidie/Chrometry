# Overview

This script forces a game object's `forward` vector to always face the camera assigned to the player. This is assigned to 2-D sprites so they are consistently visible.

The entire scripts consists of only a few lines of code:

### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Tools/AlwaysFaceCamera.cs
```c#
5      	public class AlwaysFaceCamera : MonoBehaviour
6      	{
7      		private Camera _cam;
8       
9      		private void Awake() => _cam = Camera.main; 
10          
11     		private void Update() => transform.LookAt(_cam.transform);
12     	}
```

<br/>

The script is attached as a component to a game object via the Inspector. On `Awake`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Tools/AlwaysFaceCamera.cs:9:5:5:`		private void Awake() =&gt; _cam = Camera.main; `"/>, the main camera is stored as a variable. Each frame, the game object the script is attached to is forced to look at the point the camera is centered in.

# To-Do

*   Add an additional parameter forcing the transform's `up` vector to match the camera's `up` vector so images are never displayed sideways or upside-down.
