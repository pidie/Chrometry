# Overview

The interactable trigger is used to check for interactables in front of the player. The script is attached to a game object that is empty aside from a sphere collider, which is attached to the camera position.

When the collider collides with an interactable, it will be added to `InteractablesInRange`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:53:8:8:`		public List&lt;IInteractable&gt; InteractablesInRange { get; set; } = new ();`"/> on the `PlayerController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/InteractableTrigger.cs:7:3:3:`        public PlayerController PlayerController { get; set; }`"/>. Assuming the player does a 180Â° turn, the trigger collider will eventually end collision with the interactable collider, removing that interactable from `InteractablesInRange`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:53:8:8:`		public List&lt;IInteractable&gt; InteractablesInRange { get; set; } = new ();`"/>.

This functionality prevents a player from being able to interact with an object it is not facing.

The code consists of two lines whose sole functionality is to assign the player controller.
