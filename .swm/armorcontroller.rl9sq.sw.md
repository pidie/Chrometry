title: ArmorController

app_version: 1.0.20

The `ArmorController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/ArmorController.cs:5:5:5:`    public class ArmorController : VitalsController`"/> inherits from the `VitalsController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsController.cs:9:7:7:`    public abstract class VitalsController : MonoBehaviour`"/>, so much of its functionality is found there. Its special characteristics revolve around damage mitigation and tracking priority of damage.

## Of Note

*   _Armor_ should take damage before _Health_, but not before _Shields_.
    
*   Armor should help to ensure that proper damage order is being maintained.
    
*   Armor is the only vitals metric that does not regenerate over time.
