# Overview

This component controls displays that track the health of an entity. It inherits from `VitalsDisplayUI`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsDisplayUI.cs:8:7:7:`	public abstract class VitalsDisplayUI : MonoBehaviour`"/> and is therefore able to display the player's health and that of any other entities in the game.

<br/>

## Of Note

*   The player's health display has two phases.
    
*   The first phase constitutes the first 80% of its health. During this phase, a graphic will fade from one color to another.
    
    *   Currently, that graphic is a maltese cross, fading linearly from a bright pink to black.
        
    *   The cross reaches full black when the player's health reaches 20% of its maximum.
        
*   The second phase constitutes the remaining 20% of the player's health. During this phase the image's fill amount will drop linearly, revealing a second image behind it. When that image is fully revealed, the player's health has reached 0 and the player is dead.
    
    *   Again, the image is currently a maltese cross, but it is bright red to contrast with the black.
        
    *   Once the character dies, the red cross could become larger and take up the center of the screen as the rest of the UI and screen fade to black, making for a nice _"You Died"_ screen.
        
    *   The pink cross could have runes etched into it that remain as the player's health drops in the first phase. Then, during the second phase when the player' health continues to drop, the runes could be on the red cross but etched in black.
