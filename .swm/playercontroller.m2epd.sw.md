# Fields and Properties

<br/>

<br/>

Serialized Fields - Movement
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs
```c#
16     		[SerializeField] private float movementSpeed = 5f;
17     		[SerializeField] private float runSpeedMultiplier = 1.6f;
18     		[SerializeField] private float crouchSpeedMultiplier = 0.5f;
19     		[SerializeField] private float jumpHeight = 3f;
```

<br/>

`movementSpeed`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:16:9:9:`		[SerializeField] private float movementSpeed = 5f;`"/> - how quickly the player can move<br/>
`runSpeedMultiplier`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:17:9:9:`		[SerializeField] private float runSpeedMultiplier = 1.6f;`"/> - how much faster the player runs than walks<br/>
`crouchSpeedMultiplier`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:18:9:9:`		[SerializeField] private float crouchSpeedMultiplier = 0.5f;`"/> - how much faster the player moves while crouching than not

*   a value below 1 will move the player slower
    

`jumpHeight`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:19:9:9:`		[SerializeField] private float jumpHeight = 3f;`"/> - how high the player will jump

<br/>

Serialized Fields - References
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs
```c#
22     		[SerializeField] private GameObject cameraPosition;
23     		[SerializeField] private ItemData item;
24     		[SerializeField] private GameObject weaponWheelCanvas;
```

<br/>

`cameraPosition`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:22:9:9:`		[SerializeField] private GameObject cameraPosition;`"/> - used by a Cinemachine Virtual Cam to follow the player<br/>
`item`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:23:9:9:`		[SerializeField] private ItemData item;`"/> - the item that the player is holding<br/>
`weaponWheelCanvas`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:24:9:9:`		[SerializeField] private GameObject weaponWheelCanvas;`"/> - the canvas that contains the weapon wheel

Private Fields - Player Input
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs
```c#
27     		private PlayerInputActions _playerControls;
28     		private InputAction _move;
29     		private InputAction _jump;
30     		private InputAction _run;
31     		private InputAction _crouch;
32     		private InputAction _interact;
33     		private InputAction _fire;
34     		private InputAction _secondary;
35     		private InputAction _useItem;
36     		private InputAction _weaponWheel;
```

<br/>

`_playerControls`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs:27:5:5:`		private PlayerInputActions _playerControls;`"/> - a map of all the controls and the actions they're assigned to

*   Each `InputAction` controls a specific action. When the mapped button is pressed, that action is called, providing a callback context.
    
    *   The default context is `waiting`. The other three are `started`, `performed`, and `canceled`.
        
    *   These contexts are used to determine precisely how to execute our actions.
