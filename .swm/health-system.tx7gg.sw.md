The health system uses three main components - `HealthController`, `HealthColliderController`, and `HealthDisplayUI`.

<br/>

The saved data is the `maxHealth`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:21:9:9:`        [SerializeField] private float maxHealth = 100f;`"/>, the `healthRegen`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:22:23:23:`        [SerializeField, Tooltip(&quot;Health regenerated per second&quot;)] private float healthRegen = 1.5f;`"/>, `healthRegenDelay`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:23:31:31:`        [SerializeField, Tooltip(&quot;Delay after taking damage before health will regenerate&quot;)] private float healthRegenDelay = 2.5f;`"/>, `_currentHealth`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:25:5:5:`        private float _currentHealth;`"/>, and whether or not the health `_canRegen`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Health/HealthController.cs:26:5:5:`        private bool _canRegen;`"/>.

```c#
21             [SerializeField] private float maxHealth = 100f;
22             [SerializeField, Tooltip("Health regenerated per second")] private float healthRegen = 1.5f;
23             [SerializeField, Tooltip("Delay after taking damage before health will regenerate")] private float healthRegenDelay = 2.5f;
24     
25             private float _currentHealth;
26             private bool _canRegen;
```

The `HealthController` is the main part of the health system, storing information like the current and maximum health, as well as controlling methods that can alter it. The information is private, but has public accessors. One `HealthController` should control the health of a single entity.

The `HealthColliderController` detects collisions that could affect the `HealthController`. It references a `HealthController` and activates events for it.

*   A `HealthColliderController` does not need to be on the same `GameObject` as the `HealthController` it references.
    
*   A single `HealthController` can have multiple `HealthColliderController`s referencing it.
    
*   A single `GameObject` can have multiple `HealthColliderController`s on it, but they should be referencing different `HealthController`s.
    

The `HealthDisplayUI` is used to interact with a user interface for displaying health information.
