# Overview

The `HealthController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/HealthController.cs:5:5:5:`    public class HealthController : VitalsController`"/> inherits from the `VitalsController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsController.cs:9:7:7:`    public abstract class VitalsController : MonoBehaviour`"/> class, so much of its functionality can be found there. Its special characteristics revolve around the death of the entity.

<br/>

## Of Note

*   An entity is considered any actor or structure that uses vitals.
    
*   While a structure whose health has been dropped to 0 might be thought of as _destroyed_ rather than _killed_, the word `Destroy` has a special meaning in Unity, referring to the destruction of an in-scene game object.
    
*   As such, all entities whose health has been dropped to or below 0 will be referred to as _killed_ or _dead_.
