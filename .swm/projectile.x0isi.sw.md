Projectiles are objects fired from guns. They store information on what will happen when they collide with a `VitalsColliderController`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Vitals/VitalsColliderController.cs:7:5:5:`    public class VitalsColliderController : MonoBehaviour`"/>. If they do not make said collision, they will eventually destroy themselves.

Because this deals damage, it inherits from the `IDamager` interface.

```

<br/>

`MaxDistance`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:8:5:5:`        public float MaxDistance { get; set; }`"/> - the maximum distance this instance can travel before destroying itself<br/>
`ProjectileSpeed`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:9:5:5:`        public float ProjectileSpeed { get; set; }`"/> - how quickly this instance travels<br/>
`Direction`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:10:5:5:`        public Vector3 Direction { get; set; }`"/> - the direction this instance moves in<br/>
`Damage`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:11:5:5:`        public float Damage { get; set; }`"/> - how much damage this instance deals on impact<br/>
`WillCriticallyHit`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:12:5:5:`        public bool WillCriticallyHit { get; set; }`"/> - whether or not this instance will critically hit<br/>
`CritDamageMultiplier`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:13:5:5:`        public float CritDamageMultiplier { get; set; }`"/> - a multiplier for the damage dealt

### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs
```c#
15             private Vector3 _initialPosition;
```

<br/>

`_initialPosition`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs:15:5:5:`        private Vector3 _initialPosition;`"/> - the starting point for the projectile

*   This will be the `muzzle` of the gun
    

<br/>

# Methods

<br/>

<br/>

Stores the muzzle position.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs
```c#
17             private void Awake() => _initialPosition = transform.position;
```

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

Moves the projectile forward until it passes its maximum range, in which case it destroys itself.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ Assets/Scripts/Weapons/Damagers/Projectile.cs
```c#
19             private void FixedUpdate()
20             {
21                 transform.position += Direction * ProjectileSpeed;
22                 if (Vector3.Distance(_initialPosition, transform.position) > MaxDistance)
23                     Destroy(gameObject);
24             }
```

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

Destroys the game object
